<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello! My name is Emma. I was born and raised on a chicken farm in Buffalo, MN. I participated in various clubs throughout high school such as choir, choral ensemble, theater, French club, and Anime club. I attended my Freshman year at MSU Mankato studying engineering, and transferred to the University of Minnesota to study Technical Writing my sophomore year. I currently live with my friends and my cat Dr. Doot in Minneapolis. I enjoy cooking vegan food, travelling, and dancing in my spare time.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I am a senior at the University of Minnesota studying for a B.S. in Technical Writing and Communication with a subtract in Information Technology and Design. My coursework has been focused on rhetoric, editing, and writing development. WRIT 4662W is my first experience with coding and I am excited to get started!</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p>I work as a Student Lead for the IT Service Desk at the University of Minnesota. At this position I provide Technical Support to users, leadership to my fellow student workers, and create and edit knowledge articles for public and internal use. In this role I have developed a deep passion for user support and usability that I will carry into future careers.</p>
